// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

/* The  6 Basic steps of Software Developlemt lifecycles in order are:
 1.Planning
 2.Analysis of Requirements
 3.Design
 4.Implementation
 5.Testing & Integration
 6.Maintain
*/


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/


const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisAndReruirements ="This is the second step, in which the end-user’s requirements should be determined and documented, what their expectations are for the system, and how it will perform."
const design =" This is the third step , i which a pre-production version of the product is created which can give the team the opportunity to visualize what the product will look like and make changes without having to go through the hassle of rewriting code.";
const implementation ="It's the actual construction process after having a complete and illustrated design for the requested system.the actual code is written here  and if the system contains hardware, then the implementation phase will contain configuration and fine-tuning for the hardware to meet certain requirements and functions.In this phase, the system is ready to be deployed and installed."
const testingAndIntegration ="Bringing different components and subsystems together to create the whole integrated system, and then Introducing the system to different inputs to obtain and analyze its outputs and behavior and the way it functions. "
const maintain = "In this phase, periodic maintenance for the system will be carried out to make sure that the system won’t become obsolete, this will include replacing the old hardware and continuously evaluating system’s performance, it also includes providing latest updates for certain components to make sure it meets the right standards and the latest technologies to face current security threats."
